      Clusus is a leading provider of banking and payment solutions and sister company of Progressoft which serves 370 banks and central banks in 24 countries across the globe. I work with a diverse team to build and maintain payments, checks, trade finance, and other financial software systems. My major achievements:
    responsibilities:
      - Contributed to designing, developing, and testing over 200 restful APIs.
      - Design and developed microservice with API First Design, TDD, Clean Code, and Domain-Driven Design. The outcome is APIs are consistent, documented and business models are easy to change according to customer new requirements.
      - Designed and developed API Exception Handling Framework to handle exceptions across the whole platform. The outcome is a clean way based on the separation of concerns concept (AOP) between the APIs and the exceptions responses.
      - Containerized the whole development environment and run in Kubernetes with a helm that allows one-click setup for all the development environment components and an easy way to test/handle partial failures. The outcome is a more productive development environment that allows engineers to focus on their current task and not to worry about other components of the platform.
      - Applied ELK to scale log processing and analyze the logs and detect major log events. The outcome is a systematic way to trace application failures.
      - Benchmarked the system to identify bottlenecks of the application and improved the performance of the system by 12%.
      - Developed a very rich report generation library. The outcome is many systems are using it to generate a report with minimal effort.
      - Researched on micro-service development practices, which ultimately helped to develop our first micro-service architecture based corporate payment system.
      - Initiated frontend project using Angular for the corporate payment system, and developed layouts, themes shared library. The outcome is all other UI components are based on these reusable components.

    location: Kathmandu, Nepal
    years: March 2015 - September 2016
    responsibilities:
      - Design and developed a backup system both backend and frontend using MVC architecture. The outcome is a one-click setup to perform database backup across the production environment.
      - Refactored data access layer with maintainable and high performing SQL queries. The outcome is the performance of application increased by 8%.
      - Developed rich technical documents in JIRA, which ultimately helped the customer to use an application.
